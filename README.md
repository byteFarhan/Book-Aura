## Features of this project

ðŸš€ On the homepage, I've showcased books using JSON fake data.

ðŸš€ I've implemented a book details route for each book displayed. When a user clicks on any specific book card, they are directed to the book details route corresponding to their selection.

ðŸš€ In the book details route, users will find comprehensive information about the specific book. Additionally, they have the option to save the book to their Read List or Wish List.

ðŸš€ If a user saves the book to either the Read List or Wish List, the application utilizes browser local storage to store the data regarding which books the user has saved.

ðŸš€ Users can view their listed books in the Listed Book route. Here, I've used the react-tab package to display Read Books and Wish List Books separately.

ðŸš€ Furthermore, I've implemented a custom bar chart using the Recharts package, based on the total pages of the listed Read Books and their corresponding titles in the Pages To Read route.
